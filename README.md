# FakeNews API

A really simple API that serves a json list of sites to be blocked 
by the [chrome extension](https://github.com/dimspith/fn-blacklist).

### Dependencies
    * [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

### Running
To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

The basic route that serves two example sites is at [`localhost:5000/api/fetch`](http://localhost:5000/api/fetch)
